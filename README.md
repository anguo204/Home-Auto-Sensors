The purpose of this project detect any hazardous signs around the house that includes gas leaks, floods and breaks ins. To do this we used sensors hooked up to Arduino NodeMCU WiFi Modules. This will send the data collected by the sensor into our android app, built on Android studios, which is backed by Google Firebase.
This project includes all the coding for the sensors which was done in C and it was hook up through a breadboard.
