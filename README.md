# Home-Auto-Sensors
The purpose of this project was to detect any hazardous signs around the house this includes gas leaks, floods and breaks ins. To do this we used sensors hooked up to Arduino NodeMCU WiFi Modules. This will send the data collected by the sensor into our andriod app, build on Andriod studios, backed by Google Firebase.
